Hey everyone here you can find complete implementation of composite design pattern with proper explanation.

Composite Design Pattern is a structural design pattern which is used when we have to represent a part-whole hierarchy. The composite pattern is meant to allow treating individual objects and compositions of objects, or “composites” in the same way.

Implementation of Composite Design Pattern -:
The Composite Design Pattern has four main components -:

component — is the base interface for all the objects in the composition. It should be either an interface or an abstract class with the common methods to manage the child composites.
leaf — implements the default behavior of the base component. It doesn’t contain a reference to the other objects.
composite — has leaf elements. It implements the base component methods and defines the child-related operations.
client — has access to the composition elements by using the base component object.
